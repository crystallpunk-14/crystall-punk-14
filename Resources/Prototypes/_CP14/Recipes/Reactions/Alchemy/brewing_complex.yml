# Idea:
# A more comprehensive way to get the base effects from several ingredients at once. Can give rarer effects, but at the cost of a large number of different effects in the pile.

# Rules:
# 1) all values must be multiples of 0.25
# 2) 25% products must be occupied by the empty solution
# 3) there should be 3 different effects as a result. One of them is very useful, the second useful, the third useless.
# 4) all reactions should take place at a temperature of 500, and reduce the temperature by 250.
# 5) the priority should be higher than that of a simple brewing reaction
