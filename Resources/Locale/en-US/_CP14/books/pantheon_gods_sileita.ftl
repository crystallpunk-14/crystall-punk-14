cp14-book-text-pantheon-gods-sileita = The pantheon of Sileita is divided into three great ranks: [bold]Absolutes, Elder Gods and Younger Gods[/bold]. Faith in the gods affects the political, spiritual and magical life of all the peoples of Sileita. Some deities are forbidden to worship, others are revered as official patrons of countries or organizations.
    {"[italic]'I am a Watcher, a templar of the Order of the Guardians of Truth, charged with gathering information on all the gods of Sileita without bias. We do not pray. We record. No god is worthy of worship until fully understood. None is superior to another. All are part of a complex picture.'[/italic]"}

    {"[head=2]Absolutes — First Forces[/head]"}

    {"[head=3][color=purple]Tomer[/color][/head]"}

    • [bold]Names[/bold]: [italic]Mutable, Primordial Contradiction, Sculpting. Rejected.[/italic]
    • [bold]Idea[/bold]: Chaos, metamorphosis, biological and metaphysical evolution.
    • [bold]Symbol[/bold]: Spiral of creeping forms.
    • [bold]Presence[/bold]: Physical appearance is imprisoned in a divine prison. His "comings" are catastrophes: mutations, bursts of alien biomes, falls of flesh from the sky. Tomer's influence is flashes of his energy capable of changing the environment around him.
    • [bold]Character[/bold]: He cannot be called evil — he is beyond the concepts of good. This is blind curiosity in destruction. He changes for the sake of change itself. The mind of the pulsating world, which dreams of becoming something new.
    • [bold]Attitude to mortals[/bold]: He is interested in them as material. He is not an executioner, but a craftsman. Dispassionate, but attentive.
    • [bold]Comment[/bold]: It is dangerous not so much because of its strength, but because it infects minds with the idea of destruction as a method of progress. Its prohibition by law is justified. Its teaching is a sweet poison.

    {"[head=3][color=purple]Altaran[/color][/head]"}

    • [bold]Names[/bold]: [italic]Flickering Judgement, Course of Currents, Watcher Through the Ages.[/italic]
    • [bold]Idea[/bold]: Time, temporal currents, judgement, order.
    • [bold]Symbol[/bold]: Eternal circle with internal clocks running in different directions.
    • [bold]Presence[/bold]: Never appears in the flesh. Never seen in Sileith, but has been seen in the Void.
    • [bold]Character[/bold]: Absolutely impartial. No anger in him, only equation. Disgusting to mortals because he does not forgive - but does not take revenge either. He is the unspoken leader of the entire pantheon and the controlling authority.
    • [bold]Attitude to mortals[/bold]: Sees them as units in a model. Does not deny the importance of personality, but only recognizes its influence on the course of time.
    • [bold]Comment[/bold]: If all the gods disappeared, Altaran would remain to watch their work crumble.

    {"[head=3][color=purple]Relaphir and Vestris[/color][/head]"}

    • [bold]Names[/bold]: [italic]Twins of the Passage, Key and Lock, Primordial Gate. Wolf and Sheep.[/italic]
    • [bold]Idea[/bold]: Life, death, soul, reincarnation, Void.
    • [bold]Symbol[/bold]: Intertwined circles with an eye in the center.
    • [bold]Presence[/bold]: At the moment of birth - Vestris watches. At the moment of death - Relaphir sees off. In deep silence and in the last breath - both. Only Relaphir physically appeared on Bafamir's judgment day.
    • [bold]Character[/bold]:
    - Vestris is soft and thoughtful, like a spring morning.
    - Relaphir is reserved and inevitable, like the night.
     They do not argue. [bold]Their unity is fundamental.[/bold]
    • [bold]Attitude to mortals[/bold]: They do not judge, do not encourage, do not persuade. They simply are. Accompany, without interfering.
    • [bold]Comment[/bold]: They are not terrible because of their power, but because they have the right to use it. Necromancers and experienced healers can accept the faith of the twins for the sake of studying resurrection and rebirth.

    • [bold]Character[/bold]: He was the embodiment of service. They said he was silent for hours, but with a single glance he convinced the army.
    • [bold]Attitude to mortals[/bold]: He saw in them, perhaps, more than they deserved. Believed that they were worth protecting at any cost.
