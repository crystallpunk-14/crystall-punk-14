cp14-book-text-guild-moral = The Adventurer's Guild Morale is an unofficial set of principles that helps a group of adventurers interact in a fair and respectful manner. Following these rules not only builds team morale, but also makes adventures more harmonious and interesting.

      The following are the basic tenets of Guild morals:
    ________________________________________
    1. Principle of equal sharing of treasure
    •   Common Fund: 
    All gold and valuable items found on expeditions are first placed in a common fund. After the expedition, distribution is done equally or according to each team member's contribution.
    •   Personal Finds: 
    If a player finds an item alone (e.g. when away from the group), they may keep it. However, such finds should be discussed with the team so as not to cause misunderstandings.
    •   Equipment Priority: 
    If one of the members needs a certain item to strengthen the group (e.g. if a mage has a magical staff), he is given the right to be the first to claim the item. In case the adventurer took priority in the last division, he is the last to receive the division in the next division to maintain equality.
    2. Mutual Aid and Healing
    •   Help: 
    Healing wounded team members is the responsibility of healers and those with healing skills. However, they may refuse treatment if it jeopardises the overall safety of the team (e.g. when mana is low and a more difficult battle is imminent).
    •   Consent to help: 
    No one is obligated to help someone who treats others disrespectfully or who frequently disregards the interests of the team.
    •   Support in combat: 
    Participants are not required to sacrifice themselves, but all should make an effort to support and protect each other if possible and appropriate.
    •   Fallen Adventurers: 
    If an adventurer on your team dies in a dungeon or otherwise, the group is encouraged to bring the body back to town for resurrection if possible. If it is not possible to move the body, it is advisable to take valuable items from the body for the group, as well as personal belongings of the adventurer to give to his relatives, as well as to arrange a funeral on the spot with improvised items if it is not too difficult for the group to honour the fallen.
    3. Ethics of banishment and expulsion from the team
    •   Breach of trust: 
    If a player shows aggression towards allies, steals from the common fund or constantly harms the team, he may be expelled. The decision is made collectively and unanimously, no exceptions.
    •   Chance to make amends: 
    The guild may offer the offending member a chance to make amends - with additional duties, working off damage, or helping them prepare for the next campaign.
    •   Law for all: 
    No one, not even the leader, may be removed from the team without the consent of all members. This rule ensures equality and prevents abuse of power.
    •   Leaving the group: 
    If an adventurer decides to leave the current group for any reason, he must notify every member of his group, preferably with a reason. After the adventurer leaves the group it is customary to throw a copper coin to the group (or other denomination) on the ground as a sign that even though he is leaving he does not consider them opponents, the group in return should throw a coin of the same value as a reciprocal confirmation of friendship. The coins remain on the ground and the group peacefully disperses. If the division did not take place before the separation, it must take place for the fairness of the participants. The adventurer's belongings remain with him (unless he has previously carried the belongings of another member of the group)  
    4. Priority in spending and allocation of funds
    •   Equipment purchases: 
    Priority in spending gold from the common fund is given to improving equipment that ensures the safety of the entire group (healing potions, protective amulets, etc.).
    •   Individual Needs: 
    If someone has a need for a specific item (e.g. a new set of armour), they can get approval for an additional share if it is justified.
    •   Financial Fairness: 
    Each member can make a suggestion on how best to spend the shared funds, and the decision is made by majority vote.
    5. Principles of respect and co-operation
    •   Mutual respect and honesty: 
    Insults, threats, or other acts of disrespect towards other guild members are considered a breach of morale. The team should maintain a healthy atmosphere where everyone feels valued.
    •   Everyone's Role and Contribution: 
    Respect for the roles and abilities of each member of the team is mandatory. Everyone should be able to participate as equals in the discussion of strategies and tactics.
    •   Confidentiality of decisions: 
    Internal disputes and team decisions remain within the guild. Too much discussion of these topics with outsiders can lead to unnecessary conflict or ruined relationships with other groups.
    6. Commitment to the Guild
    •   Return Pledge: 
    Each adventurer pledges to return to the guild with an account of their actions, regardless of the outcome of the mission. Remember, an adventurer who fails an assignment is better off dead. You must be prepared to die, but still have comrades and family waiting for you.
    •   Completing missions to the end: 
    Abandoning a mission in the middle of the path is considered not only a breach of morality, but also disrespectful to the entire guild. Exceptions are in cases of life threatening situations that cannot be countered.
    •   Maintaining an adventurous spirit: 
    Guildmates not only complete a mission, but also strive to maintain the honour and moral face of the guild in front of other groups and communities.
