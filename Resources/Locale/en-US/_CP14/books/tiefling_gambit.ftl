    •[bold]Objective:[/bold] Win by rolling the highest number in the round
    
    •[bold]Instructions:[/bold] The players must decide on a buy-in, to which they will add to a pot in the middle of the table.
    (eg. each of the 4 players add [color=chocolate]5c[/color], making the pot [color=chocolate]20c[/color] total)
    
    After the buy-in, each player makes their initial roll with one d6 die in clockwise rotation; [bold]the player with the highest roll wins the pot.[/bold]
    
    If more than one player rolls the same winning number, this is known as a [bold]PUSH[/bold]. Those specific players will collectively roll again, whoever rolls highest wins.
    
    •[bold]Gambit Roll: [/bold]After the table finishes their initial roll, players who rolled a 1 may choose to buy a re-roll for half of the original buy-in. In the case of a push round, gambit rolls are made [bold]BEFORE[/bold] the push, [color=red]not after[/color]
