cp14-book-bestiary = Bestiary of creatures from the Adventurers Guild "Wind of Silphoria"
      First edition.
      Hello adventurer, we are the same seekers as you, we studied the creatures so that it would be easier for new recruits to meet this threat and get a better chance of survival. Remember that we are volunteers and not all knowledge can be absolutely accurate, but we tried to find out as much truth about these creatures as possible.
      Undead:
      Zombies
      •Description: Slow undead, created either by the magic of necromancers, or by an unsettled soul during a cruel death. Outwardly, these are half-decayed, sometimes armed creatures, driven by dull instincts to devour fresh meat.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics: Zombies attack in a group, surrounding the target and using the numerical advantage. They are not afraid of pain and continue to move, even if they are deprived of limbs. Their blows are not accurate, but their jaws work properly.
      oOften serve as "cannon fodder" for other, more powerful creatures.
      •Strengths:
      oA lone zombie is not as scary as a crowd of rotten ones. A crowd can corner you and taste your body. Always make sure there is an escape route
      oSmell. God knows how they do it, but even in complete darkness they can sniff out your body. Therefore, always even the score - make sure you have lighting to see this rot behind you before it bites off your arm
      •Weaknesses:
      oVery slow. If you are not wounded, you can escape from the crowd even on foot in armor. But we would not advise walking calmly like on a walk

      Skeleton
      •Description: Semi-intelligent undead, mainly living in demiplanes. Usually armed with a bone glaive and honestly, no matter how much we studied these creatures, we still don’t understand where they get the bone blade from, maybe they make it from each other. They also often make torches for themselves, because they can’t see in the dark. Ironically, among the skeletons there are “adequate” creatures with whom you can even communicate, but most often they run at you like idiots, screaming at the whole demiplane.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics:
      Skeletons most often try to make tactical decisions, understanding their weakness against a group of adventurers. Traps, using zombies as a human shield or reinforcements, snatching weapons from an adventurer - all these are the delights of fighting them. Correctly assess the situation in a fight with them. Their weapons are not as dangerous as a regular sword, but they wave them often, and they do not wear armor, their movements are not limited by anything. In combat, they try to focus on weak targets, such as mages or wounded characters. Try to cover each other and then the skeleton will not become a serious problem.
      •Strengths:
      oAgility and quick reaction. Using primitive tactics taking into account the terrain.
      oWell organized in a group if there are several skeletons.
      •Weaknesses:
      oThe fragile structure of the body makes them vulnerable to blows. A couple of accurate blows and they crumble into dog food.

      Hydra
      •Description: two-headed snake monster. An extremely nimble creature and likes to hide in the grass.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics:
      Crawls up very quickly and most often unexpectedly for the group - watch your step.
      •Strengths:
      oSometimes they gather in flocks, but they are not a big threat
      oHigh movement speed - it is extremely problematic to escape from them
      •Weaknesses:
      oExtremely weak body, even a couple of ice shards will make this snake go to its paradise

      Mosquito Swarm
      •Description: A cluster of bloodsucking insects united in a swarm. These extremely tenacious mosquitoes are a real headache, forcing you to leave your shelters right into a crowd of more dangerous creatures.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics:
      They attack in mass, continuously exhausting the target.
      Their bites are almost not dangerous in themselves, but the speed at which they suck out your nutritional juices is faster than that of a dwarf with a cup of ale.
      Almost invisible in the dark. And you know that adventurer - almost is a very inappropriate word. Most often, you will notice them when you hear a nasty "zzz" next to your ear.
      •Strengths:
      oCompletely ignore physical damage from single attacks. This swarm will literally get tired of clapping your hands or chopping with daggers. Burn them with flame, preferably immediately over the area, making fried powder for fish out of them.
      oExtremely invisible in the dark. Carefully monitor the situation, especially in caves. It is better to throw a couple of simple lights from afar than to waste several liters of your blood trying to do it on the spot.
      •Weaknesses:
      oVulnerable to mass-effect fire spells
      oApart from a chance to dry out slightly, they do not pose a serious threat.

      Six-legged moles
      •Description: Underground predators with incredible digging power and sudden attacks from the ground. I don’t know how such a creature was created on this or other worlds, but when it crawled out right under the feet of one of the researchers, he “almost” wet himself. You see, Zevr, I wrote almost, please don’t make me rewrite the edition because of your screw-up.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics:
      Moles most often suddenly attack from underground, aiming at single targets and preventing spellcasters from using their skills. Try to always have at least one warrior with a sword and shield in the squad.
      If the battle is not in their favor, they quickly burrow back and crawl out to regroup.
      oThere are often 2-3 individuals next to a mole, so they are a real thorn in the side of lone adventurers.
      •Strengths:
      oHigh stealth and surprise attacks.
      oExtremely maneuverable animals, if they can be classified as ordinary animals. Although their meat is tasty, of course.
      •Weaknesses:
      oDependent on the underground environment, they lose their advantage in open terrain. And an extremely easy target for an equipped warrior.

      Yumkaraptor Dinosaurs
      •Description: A bipedal lizard slightly taller than a human, living in forests in open nature. And at least one of them was a herbivore... eh. These dinosaurs are green with brown spots on their backs. Don't worry if you can't see well over long distances. They will quickly run up to you so you can get a better look at them.
      •Behavior:
      oBattle tactics:
      Predators attack quickly, using speed and sharp teeth. It is unrealistic to escape from this species even if you run in your underwear.
      Despite the fact that their physique does not particularly protect against cold weapons, they do not particularly try to retreat during a battle, which often ruins the lives of spellcasters.
      Usually act alone, but can be part of a pack.
      •Strengths:
      oHigh speed of predators. Try to get armor to meet them and especially protect spellcasters and archers.
      •Weaknesses:
      oIn a fight against a group, they do not pose a big threat
      oTraps and obstacles can stop their advance. Use the terrain to your needs. Make dinosaurs regret that they are not herbivores!
      So the first edition of the Bestiary has come to an end. I hope these tips will help you, adventurer, not go to your ancestors ahead of time. Support Bestiary if you want by donating to your guildmaster. We'll be pleased. Good luck, friend!
