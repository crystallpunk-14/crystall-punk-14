    â€¢ [bold]Names[/bold]: [italic]Echo-Spirits, Mask-Wearers, Pseudo-Divines.[/italic]
    
    Imitators are beings, spirits, phantoms or possessed that take on the appearance, speech, habits and goals of one of the gods, without their blessing or sanction. They are not true servants, but can outwardly indistinguishably copy divine manifestations. This phenomenon occurs both in ritual art and magic of persuasion, and in unconscious forms of distorted faith. There are also unique creatures created unconsciously, under the influence of magical anomalies, egregors (collective mind) of faith or the Void.

    {"[head=2]General about the nature of Imitators[/head]"}

    They do not receive power from the god himself, but can use rituals that imitate miracles and / or the energy of the god.
    Often appear in places of great religious tension - in empty temples, on battlefields where the gods were worshipped, or in regions forgotten by the priesthood.
    Some Mimics are spirits that arose from the echoes of a collective faith and absorbed the energy of the gods, others are mortals captivated by the idea.
    Sometimes a god knows about the Mimic, but does not react - considering it 'the noise of faith'.

    {"[head=2]Typology of Imitators[/head]"}

    {"[head=3][color=goldenrod]Shadow Faces[/color][/head]"}

    Creatures that copy the appearance and habits of gods. Often they are spirits that were filled with the energy of gods at the time of evolution, or lived at that time in places of religious indignation.
    {"[italic]Example[/italic]: A spirit living at the altar of a goddess takes on her appearance and habits, becoming a weak copy."}

    {"[head=3][color=goldenrod]Echo Spirits[/color][/head]"}

    Incorporeal formations that arise from an excess of prayers or fear. They have no will, but reflect a specific side of the god - the wrath of Jelaryon, the compassion of the Archfey, etc. They can 'infect' people, making them temporary carriers of a behavioral pattern. They often appear next to children who have experienced religious trauma or ecstasy.
    {"[italic]Example[/italic]: the silhouette of Irumel in ruined temples calling for compassion."}

    {"[head=3][color=goldenrod]Theomims ('godlike')[/color][/head]"}

    A spirit that has adopted the energy of a god or void during its development and has evolved into a higher spirit, becoming closer to its god. Can show self-awareness or become possessed by other beings, become an evil caricature of a god - mnemostealers. These are evil, fanatical copies of gods. They steal the image, speech and power of a deity, distort them, act on behalf of which they did not receive. Some mnemostealers gather their own 'false cultists', convincing them of their authenticity.

    {"[head=3][color=goldenrod]Splinters of Will[/color][/head]"}

    Appear in places where a god has previously manifested. These are fragments of past manifestations that have lost contact with the source. They are unreasonable, but carry the habits, voice and behavior pattern of the deity. They are a 'living' memory of the events of the god at that moment. Can be dangerous if they believe that they need to 'fulfill the will' again
