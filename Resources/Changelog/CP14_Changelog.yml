  - message: Tweaked slime damage resistances and immunities. Elemental slimes are
      now immune to their own elements, but weak to an opposing element. Electric
      slimes take equal damage from both heat and cold, and have had their oppressive
      stunlocking power somewhat reduced. Additionally, all slimes are now immune
      to airloss damage.
