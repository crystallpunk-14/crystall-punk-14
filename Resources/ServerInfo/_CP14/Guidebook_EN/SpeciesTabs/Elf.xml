Elves are a race very similar to humans, but have no common ancestors. They can be found in any corner of Sileitha, but most often living near forests or reserves.

## Ancient Magic

Elves have a magic reserve 2 times higher than normal, but their natural regeneration of magical energy is 2 times weaker. 

## Careful Mana Manipulation

Elves can't take the Mana Absorption spell, but they have an improved version of it that absorbs energy 2x faster, and is safe for the target.
