Elves are a race very similar to humans, but have no common ancestors. They can be found in any corner of Sileitha, but most often living near forests or reserves.

## Ancient Magic

Elves have a magic reserve 2 times higher than normal, but their natural regeneration of magical energy is 2 times weaker. 

Also, elves initially have basic and advanced metamagic.
