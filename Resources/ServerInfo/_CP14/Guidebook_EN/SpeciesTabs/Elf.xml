Elves are a race very similar to humans, but have no common ancestors. They can be found in any corner of Sileitha, but most often living near forests or reserves.

## Ancient Magic

Elves have a magic reserve 5 times higher than normal, but their natural regeneration of magical energy is nearly nullified. 

## Careful Mana Manipulation

Elves cannot take the Mana Consume spell, but they have an improved version of it that absorbs energy without the standard 20% loss.
