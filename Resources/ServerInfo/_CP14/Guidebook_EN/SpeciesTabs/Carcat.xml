The Carkats are a desert nation inhabiting the harsh expanse of the Great Dune Desert. They are known for their endurance, isolation, and deep connection to their ancestors. Their homeland is Bafamir, a state that rose from the ashes of war, disaster and harsh conditions, held together by the iron will of the Sultan and the overriding clans. In other lands they are often found as mercenaries, traders and artisans.

## Game Features
- Carkats are naturally endowed with sharp claws that deal enhanced damage in melee combat.
- Wearing shoes? Not for them. Where have you seen shoes that will fit over clawed paws?
- Soft paws - soft pads ensure a completely silent footstep.
- Night vision - nature has given carcats excellent night vision - they see in the dark almost as well as they do in daylight. Combined with their silent walk, this makes them ideal hunters.
- Carkats initially have basic and advanced athletic.

## Cultural Features
- Ancestral nation: the Carkats do not worship gods - they honor the spirits of their ancestors, believing them to be the guardians of boundaries and law.
- Anonymity of power: the Sultans of Bafamir have no name, clan or face. Their figure is a symbol of the will of the entire desert.
- Tribal ties: far from their homeland, the Carkats are very warm towards tribesmen, setting them apart from other races.
