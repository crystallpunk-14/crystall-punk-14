Goblins are a race of stunted goblinoids that have settled en masse throughout Sylate. Although the other races are prejudiced against them, goblins rarely try to cause trouble on purpose.

## Smallness of body

Goblins are rather short in stature, and this greatly affects their lifestyle:
- It's harder to pull large objects
- Others find it easier to pull goblins
- Reduced hitbox. Goblins are harder to hit
- All incoming damage increased by 20%. Except for poisons. Poisons, on the other hand, do 50% less damage
- Faster recovery from stamina crit
- Have more stamina

## Smallness of soul

Nature has deprived goblins of the gift of magic:
- Maximum mana reserve reduced by 75%
- Mana regeneration rate increased by 1.5 times

## Goblin Agility

Goblins cannot take the Sprint spell, but they have an improved version of it that speeds up more than usual
