The Tieflings are a race of humanoid demonoids that left the Fire Archipelago long ago. They are heavily populated throughout Sylate and have integrated themselves into the culture of all lands.

# Link with Fire

- Tieflings take 2x less damage from fire, but 2x more damage from cold.
- Basic mana regeneration is slightly impaired, but taking fire damage greatly speeds up mana regeneration, while frostbite on the contrary causes mana drain.
- Tieflings can slowly regenerate damage from fire burns.
- Fire spells spend 40% less mana, but all other types spend 20% more mana
- Tieflings initially have basic and advanced pyrokinesis.
