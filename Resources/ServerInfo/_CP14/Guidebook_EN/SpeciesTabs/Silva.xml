Silvas - Don't have a lore description of the race in the guidebook yet. We await the text from the Wanderer.

## Magical photosynthesis

Silvas regenerate [protodata="CP14MobSilva" comp="CP14MagicEnergyPhotosynthesis" member="DaylightEnergy"/] mana while in sunlight, but without it they gradually lose [protodata="CP14MobSilva" comp="CP14MagicEnergyPhotosynthesis" member="DarknessEnergy"/] mana. 

## Blessing of the silvas

Silvas cannot take the Plant Growth spell, but they have an improved version of it that uses less mana. Silvas are considered plants for these spells, so you can use them to restore hunger, thirst, and health to silvas just like you can restore health and resources to regular plants.
