The Silva are a race of humanoid plants living in deep relic forests. Emerging from the mother tree in the centre of their cities, the Silva's do not travel the world very often.

## Magical photosynthesis

Silva's regenerate [protodata="CP14MobSilva" comp="CP14MagicEnergyPhotosynthesis" member="DaylightEnergy"/] mana while in sunlight, but without it, mana regeneration is completely absent.

Silva's can also drink water to regenerate small amounts of mana; life-giving moisture gives the silva a large amount of mana.

## Connection with nature

Silva's initially have basic and advanced vivification.
