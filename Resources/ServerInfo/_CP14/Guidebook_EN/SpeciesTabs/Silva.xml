The Silva are a race of humanoid plants living in deep relic forests. Emerging from the mother tree in the centre of their cities, the Silvas do not travel the world very often.

## Magical photosynthesis

Silvas regenerate [protodata="CP14MobSilva" comp="CP14MagicEnergyPhotosynthesis" member="DaylightEnergy"/] mana while in sunlight, but without it, mana regeneration is completely absent. 

## Connection with nature

Silvas initially have basic and advanced vivification.
