Recidivism: repeat commission of a crime.
Cultural aspect: if the crime violates the canons of religion, traditions or laws of a specific race/faction, this is taken into account (for example, desecration of a shrine).

## Section III. The Judicial System
The case is being considered:

Representatives of the guards - for minor and moderate crimes.
By the Imperial Court or the commander of the guard - for medium and serious crimes. The commander of the guard also has the right to delegate authority to a trusted person.

When considering a case, government officials have the right to independently choose a punishment consistent with the category of crimes after taking into account all modifiers, and also if the victim of the crime did not use the right to a duel.
