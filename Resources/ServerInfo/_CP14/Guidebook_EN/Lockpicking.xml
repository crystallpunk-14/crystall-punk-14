  #Lockpicking
  Lockpicking is an action of attempting to unlock a locked Chest or Door in order to gain access. Lockpicks can be store on Key Rings spawned on your character for ease of storage.

  This action is consider ILLEGAL if used to gain access to restricted areas.

  #Type of Lockpicks
  There is two lockpicks available using the following metals:
  -Iron
  -Mithril

  All lockpicks function the same. The only difference between the type of metal lockpicks is the durability of the lockpick.

  #Steps of Lockpicking
  1. Hold the lockpick on the active hand.

  2. Right-click a locked door/chest and hover over "Pick the lock" option.

  3. Pick a number from -2 to 2. This process will take a bit to trigger.
  -If the number you selected is incorrect, the lock will reset itself, a loud click can be heard and you would have to do the process all over again.
  -If the number you selected is correct, you will hear a soft click instead.

  4. Continue the guessing process until you succeed 3 to 7 times depending on what metal lock it is.
