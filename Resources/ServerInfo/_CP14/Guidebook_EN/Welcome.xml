# Welcome to the pre-alpha version of CrystallEdge!

This guide is designed to help you understand how all the mechanics in the game work.
Be prepared for a lot of text - CP14 is a very large game with a lot of deep mechanics. We hope you will find these guides interesting.

## What is CrystallEdge?
CrystallEdge is an fork of the Space Station 14 game... Eeee, I don't think there's much to write about at this point. We'll fill that in later.

## Where to start?
No idea, good luck. (This block needs to be rewritten too)
