and other information intermediaries are located, providing services to violators of the

Definitions.

A build is an object of Agreement, the result of the original author's work or a team of
authors (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), a complex intellectual property object
– a video game that includes, but is not limited to, source, object code, tools, game assets,
specifications, UI/UX design, elements of narrative and other creative content based on
the revision and translation into Russian of the open version of Space Station 14 and the
artistic vision of the authors. The set of individual elements is a Build. Any elements other
than the original elements are objects of copyright and/or related rights created by the
creative work of the collective.

Contribution – means any original author's work of Contributors, including any
modifications or additions to the Build (any source code, object code, correction, tool,
sample, graphics, assets, specifications, manuals, documentation), which is intentionally
provided by the Licensee to the Licensor. For the purposes of this definition,
submission means any form of electronic, oral or written communication sent to Licensor
or its representatives, including, but not limited to, messages on electronic mailing lists,
source code control systems and issue tracking systems operated by or on behalf of the
Company for the purposes of discussing or improving software or project documentation
and source. Communications for which it is explicitly stated in writing as "Not a
contribution" will not be considered a contribution. When providing a Contribution to the
Build, the Contributor provides the Company with a simple, free, irrevocable, non-exclusive
license for the entire period of validity of the Contributor's rights to the Contribution provided
for by the legislation of the state-jurisdiction of the Contributor
and/or international legislation for certain forms of Contribution.

The scope of the rights granted.

The license grants an unlimited number of persons the right to copy and make changes
solely for the purpose of improving the game and subject to the further transfer of such
changes to "Crystallpunk" on the terms of the Contribution, as well as for non-public hosting and
launching the Build on the Licensee's computer for the purpose of non-commercial use
for its intended purpose (providing access to Players and the Game process). This license
expressly prohibits commercial use, public hosting, as well as non-licensed use. The use
of the Build or its elements in violation of the terms of this License grants the Licensor
the right to contact the hosting provider and other persons – information intermediaries
to block hosting. The Licensee can carry out public hosting of the Build only if they receive
direct permission from the Licensor.

A reservation about the types of licenses.

Individual elements of the Build (graphics, sounds, source code) may be distributed under
a license other than this one. Most assets are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 unless
otherwise specified. Assets have their own license and copyright in the metadata file. If
the license type is not specified, such files are distributed under the terms of this license.
