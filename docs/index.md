# Pilgrimage

## Introduction

Pilgrimage is a multiplayer roleplaying survival game based on [Crystall Punk](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/crystall-punk-14), a fork from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).

## Concept

This island draws shipwrecked souls to its shores, erasing their memories and leaving them without names or pasts. A single thought is planted in their minds: "Follow the path." Stranded and disoriented, they must now surviveâ€”battling their own needs and the untamed wilderness.

Near the coast, a small village lies in ruins, abandoned long ago. From here, a mysterious path winds into the heart of the forest, beckoning those who dare to venture deeper.
